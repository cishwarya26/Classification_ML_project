# Classification_ML_project
This is a Home project done as part of the Machine Learning lecture during my Master studies.

Objective of this project is to classify the signal observed by a telescope either as a "Gamma signal" or "background signal" using different Machine Learning algorithms

Training and test data is obtained from UCI Machine learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/magic+gamma+telescope)

Three classifiers namely Decision Tree, KNN and SVM are implemented using Python Scikit Library and accuracy is calculated across the classifiers and performance is compared.
